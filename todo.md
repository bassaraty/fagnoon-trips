## Fagnoon Reservation System Conversion - Todo List

### Step 1: Analyze Current System (Completed)
- [X] Gather information about the existing Fagnoon Reservation System (architecture, technologies, features).
- [X] Identify all frontend components, views, and assets.
- [X] Identify all backend API endpoints, business logic, and database schema.
- [X] Understand the existing authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### Step 2: Setup Development Environment (Completed)
- [X] Install PHP, Composer, Node.js, npm/yarn.
- [X] Install Laravel globally or via Composer.
- [X] Set up a local database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

### Step 3: Create Laravel + Vite Project (Completed)
- [X] Create a new Laravel project.
- [X] Install and configure Vite for Laravel.
- [X] Set up basic project structure (directories for controllers, models, views, frontend assets).

### Step 4: Migrate Backend Code (Partially Completed - Database schema migrated. Models/controllers will follow.)
- [X] Recreate database schema using Laravel migrations. (Completed as per handoff using SQLite)
- [X] Port existing backend models to Laravel Eloquent models. (Copied, needs review and adaptation)
- [X] Re-implement API endpoints as Laravel routes and controllers. (Copied, needs review, adaptation, and business logic migration)
- [X] Migrate business logic to appropriate Laravel service classes or controllers. (Services copied, controllers reviewed, adaptation in progress)
- [X] Seed database with any necessary initial data. (Seeders ran successfully after fixing schema and dependency issues)

### Step 5: Integrate Frontend with Vite (React components copied, dependencies installed, working on resolving MUI Grid2 issue)
- [X] Move existing frontend code (e.g., React, Vue, Angular components, styles, images) into the Laravel project's resources/js and resources/css directories. (Copied to resources/js/fagnoon_app and resources/css, app.jsx updated)
- [X] Configure Vite to compile frontend assets. (Build successful after fixing Grid2 and CSS path issues)
- [X] Update frontend code to make API calls to the new Laravel backend routes (same origin). (All identified API calls in EventsContentAllCards, TripsInputs, EventDataContext, and UserAuthContext have been updated)
- [X] Ensure frontend routing works correctly within the Laravel application (e.g., using Laravel's routing for initial page load and client-side routing for SPA navigation). (Catch-all route added to web.php)

### Step 6: Implement Authentication System
- [X] Implement user authentication using Laravel's built-in features (e.g., Breeze, Jetstream) or a custom solution. (Laravel Breeze is set up, UserAuthContext updated to use Breeze endpoints for login/logout/session check)
- [ ] Ensure session management works correctly for the monolithic application.
- [ ] Secure API endpoints with authentication middleware.

### Step 7: Test Functionality and Fix Issues
- [ ] Perform thorough testing of all features of the reservation system.
- [ ] Test user registration, login, and logout.
- [ ] Test reservation creation, viewing, updating, and deletion.
- [ ] Verify that all API calls are working correctly and there are no CORS or session issues.
- [ ] Ensure the frontend UI and UX are identical to the current SPA.
- [ ] Perform cross-browser and responsive design testing.

### Step 8: Deploy and Document Solution
- [ ] Prepare the application for deployment (e.g., optimize assets, configure environment variables).
- [ ] Deploy the monolithic application to a suitable hosting environment.
- [ ] Create documentation for the new system, including setup, architecture, and any changes made.
